      <description>This is tutorial slides for week4 ​ The first thing that we discussed in this week is two important theorems, Nyquist&amp;rsquo;s and Shannon&amp;rsquo;s theorem, in physical layer. The main difference between them is Nyquist&amp;rsquo;s theorem assums the channel that we used to transform data is noise-less while the Shannon&amp;rsquo;s theorem is only used for a noisy channel. They both have two components in their formula, bandwidth and levels of signal.</description>

      <description>This is tutorial slides for week3 ​ In this week, we have compared the properties between OSI model and TCP/IP model. They both have a similar stacking protocol achitecture, which holds advantages on flexibility and information hiding (content in week2). In terms of differences, OSI model has a good distinguish between Service, Protocol and Interface. In the meanwhile, TCP/IP doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
​ Service defines what the process does, but not how entities above it access it or how the layer works.</description>

      <description>This is tutorial for week2 ​ In week 2, we have learned how to use Wireshark and wget to test the network
​ We simply introduced IP address, three-way handshake, overhead and layer achetechture.
​ Hope you have fun with this subject and my tutorial.
​ This is my slides.
Cheers,
