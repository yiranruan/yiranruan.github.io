​ Week 9 is an interesting week. We still focused on transport layer with its incredible protocols. The first question is about UDP, another communication protocol that we use in TL.

      This is tutorial slides for week9 ​ Sorry for the late update.
​ In this week, we have talked about deadlock, 3-way handshake and 2-army problems. Due to no solution for 2-army problems as for now, both 2-way handshake and 3-way handshake have risk to encouneter deadlock. To solve this problem, we use connection release as a example, to show you how important timer is in our system. Timer would set a time and expected to receive reply during this period.

​ In terms of routing algorithms. There are two categroies. One is non-adaptive algorithm. Routers would calculate the next hop when the network is booted. Another one is adaptive algorithm, which would make desicions depending on information collected from the environment.

      This is tutorial slides for week7 ​ In this week, we have discussed about MACA protocol, IP address (mainly about prefix and subnetmask) and fragmentation.
​ MACA, which is an wonderful protocol to help us aviod collisions withour carrier sense medium. The basic idea is that for the sender to stimulate the receiver into outputting a short frame, so stations nearby can detect this transmission and avoid transmitting for the duration of the upcoming (large) data frame.

      This is tutorial slides for week6 ​ In this week, we have discussed about several protocols that we used in Data Link layer and a brief introduction about IP address.
​ The first protocol is stop-and-wait. It is pretty simple. The sender sends one frame and then waits for an acknowledgement before proceeding.
​ Then we talked about CRC, one kind of the checksum that we used in data link layer.

      This is tutorial slides for week4 ​ The first thing that we discussed in this week is two important theorems, Nyquist&rsquo;s and Shannon&rsquo;s theorem, in physical layer. The main difference between them is Nyquist&rsquo;s theorem assums the channel that we used to transform data is noise-less while the Shannon&rsquo;s theorem is only used for a noisy channel. They both have two components in their formula, bandwidth and levels of signal.
