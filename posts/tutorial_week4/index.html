<p>​       The first thing that we discussed in this week is two important theorems, Nyquist&rsquo;s and Shannon&rsquo;s theorem, in physical layer. The main difference between them is Nyquist&rsquo;s theorem assums the channel that we used to transform data is noise-less while the Shannon&rsquo;s theorem is only used for a noisy channel. They both have two components in their formula, bandwidth and levels of signal. However, in Shannon&rsquo;s theorem, we use S/N to define the maximum levels that we could seen in a noisy channel ( S/N means singnal strength (S) relative to the noise (N) ).</p>

<p>​       The second part of our tutorail is about three methods used in data link layer, the layer above physical layer. In order to distingush different frames in reciever end, the first method that we use is called Character Count. One additional byte would be added before frame and that the value of that byte represents the total size of one frame, including itself.</p>

<p>​       Because a bad performance in real world (if the counter byte is changed during transformation, the receiver would read frames from the bit stream in a totally incorrect way), we introduce a better solution which is called flge byte. In order to distinguish the flag byte (01111110) in the payload and flag bytes that we use as indicator of begining and ending of one frame, ESC byte is used here, which is byte stuffing method.</p>

<p>​       Byte stuffing method would consume a lot of bandwidth when transform a message which includes lots of flag bytes or ESC bytes. A better method here is bit stuffing. For each 5 consective 1s that we count in original data, we insert one zero after the fifth one. By this way, it is impossible for flag bytes to be existence in payload.</p>

<p>​       Another interesting point here is before handing the received data to the upper layer (Network layer), data link layer would remove any Flag Byte or ESC Byte  or zero Indicators and original data would be recoveried and used by network layer. Network layer knows nothing about what happend in data link layer. This is what we called information hidden from upper layer, which is an important and good aspect of layer architecture. We have talked about this advantage in week2.</p>

<p>​       Hope you understand the content of our tutorial well. Have a good day. Here is the <a href="/slides/week4.pdf">slides</a>.</p>
