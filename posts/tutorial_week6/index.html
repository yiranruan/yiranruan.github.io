<p>​       In this week, we have discussed about several protocols that we used in Data Link layer and a brief introduction about IP address.</p>

<p>​        The first protocol is stop-and-wait. It is pretty simple. The sender sends one frame and then waits for an acknowledgement before proceeding.</p>

<p>​        Then we talked about CRC, one kind of the checksum that we used in data link layer. The algorithm is showed in the slides. I recommend you to review corresponding  content on the lecturer slides again for more details.</p>

<p>​        Next is pure ALOHA and slotted ALOHA. Keep in your mind that slotted ALOHA would twice the throughput comparing to that of pure ALOHA. And in different load environment, they act different.</p>

<p>​        The last protocol is adaptive tree walk protocol. The stations are regarded as the leaves of a binary tree.</p>

<p>​        Finally we talked about what IP address is and had a overview of its structure.</p>

<p>​       Hope you understand the content of our tutorial well. Have fun with your mid-term exam. Have a good day. Here is the <a href="/slides/week6.pdf">slides</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
