<p>​       In this week, we have discussed about Aggregation of IP addresses. Then we talked about one method to find correct network that one IP address belongs to.</p>

<p>​       In terms of routing algorithms. There are two categroies. One is non-adaptive algorithm. Routers would calculate the next hop when the network is booted. Another one is adaptive algorithm, which would make desicions depending on information collected from the environment.</p>

<p>​       Then two routhing algorithms are introduced. One is called Dijkstra, which is a popular algorithm to find shortest path in network. Another is called Distance Vector routing algorithm, which is one of adaptive algorithms. Router would collect routing tables from its neighbours and build a new routing table based on these information.</p>

<p>​      That&rsquo;s all. Thank you for coming my tutorial this week. See you next week. Here is the <a href="/slides/week8.pdf">slides</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
