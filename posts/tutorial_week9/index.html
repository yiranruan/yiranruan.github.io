<p>​       Sorry for the late update.</p>

<p>​        In this week, we have talked about deadlock, 3-way handshake and 2-army problems. Due to no solution for 2-army problems as for now, both 2-way handshake and 3-way handshake have risk to encouneter deadlock. To solve this problem, we use connection release as a example, to show you how important timer is in our system. Timer would set a time and expected to receive reply during this period. If not, the end would send their message agian.</p>

<p>​      Next topic is about TCP header. TCP is a popular protocol that we use for nowadays. We use port number in TCP header to identify a specific connection built between two processes. Process created by application would bind themselve with some port number if they need to use network.</p>

<p>​      That&rsquo;s all. Thank you for coming my tutorial this week. See you next week. Here is the <a href="/slides/week9.pdf">slides</a>. Appologize again for the late update.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
